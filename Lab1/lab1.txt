Your name
- Josue Martin Guillen

What is your major?
- Mechatronics Engineering

Why are you in this class?
- Originally wanted to clear this course out of my MAP, now I would like to pursue becoming a ,,hobbyist" 
programmer after seeing what can be done with the skill.

What do you think you will learn?
So far I have learned about arrays, multi-dimensional arrays, libraries and it's built in functions.

Anything else that you would like to share with the class (NOTE: this will be public so only post something you would like public).
- Playing catch-up right now. I believe that I will be able to accomplish this feat of this by the end of the semester. This assignment
does not need to be credited, however, I do like the feeling that I am starting from scratch and completing the assignments.
